Logistic Regression Implementation

This project contains a Python implementation of a logistic regression algorithm. The point of this is to help deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts. 
It demonstrates how logistic regression works internally, covering model initialization, gradient descent optimization, loss calculation, and prediction.

Features
  Custom implementation of logistic regression
  Supports binary classification tasks
  Includes:
    Sigmoid activation
    Cross-entropy loss
    Gradient descent optimization
    Simple and easy-to-follow code structure
    Example usage included

Installation
  Clone this repository:
  git clone
  Install required dependencies:
  pip install numpy
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install scikit-learn

How It Works
Sigmoid Function: Converts the linear output into a probability between 0 and 1.

Loss Function: Uses binary cross-entropy to measure the error.

Gradient Descent: Updates weights and bias to minimize the loss.

Prediction: Assigns class labels based on a threshold (default 0.5).
